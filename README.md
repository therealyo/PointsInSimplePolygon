# PointsInSimplePolygon
University project for finding all points inside given simple polygon on the plane 

In file App/Polygons.txt we store (x, y) pairs of  coordinates of the vertexes of polygons assuming they are ordered in such way that every edge hasnt got any intersections with other edges 

We create edge taking two following points in our list

Empty line is delimiter between two polygons
